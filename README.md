# Blindle Game

This is a game based on 'Wordle', the goal of which is also to guess a five-letter word. 
But unlike 'Wordle', you will learn the verdicts for each word only after the sixth word is entered. 
If the word you want to guess is not among those words, you will have one attempt to guess it based on the verdicts you have.
